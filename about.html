  <p>My name is Luke, but a lot of my friends call me "Guru".</p>
  <p>I'm a web developer and designer from the UK who likes to travel.<br>See my portfolio at <a href="http://www.lukeharvey.co.uk">www.lukeharvey.co.uk</a>.</p>
  <p>I also like watching films, going to gigs and music festivals, attempting to take arty photos and making cocktails.</p>
  <p>In 2013 I set off on my longest trip yet, to see if I can make a living as a "digital nomad".</p>
