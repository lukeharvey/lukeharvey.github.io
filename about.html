    <h1>About</h1>
  </header>
  
  <p>My name is Luke, but a lot of my friends call me "Guru".</p>
  <p>I'm a web designer and developer who also likes to travel.<br>See my portfolio at <a href="http://www.lukeharvey.co.uk">www.lukeharvey.co.uk</a>.</p>
  <p>I also like films, live music, photography and making cocktails.</p>
  <p>Not too long ago I realised all I needed to do my job is my laptop and an internet connection, and that I could be anywhere in the world.</p>
  <p>I booked a one-way flight to Thailand and decided to try my luck as a "digital nomad".</p>
