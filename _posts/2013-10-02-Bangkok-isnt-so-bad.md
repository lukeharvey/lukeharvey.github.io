I flew into Bangkok filled with slight apprehension. I'd heard and read so much about the place, I didn't know what to believe.

Some had described a bustling, multi-faceted city which keeps the eyes and tastebuds constantly entertained. Others had described a sweaty, seedy and hectic place that they wanted to escape from as soon as they got there.

I knew I had a week there, longer than most give it, and I had only a rough agenda. There are several touristy things that everyone has to do in Bangkok, like visiting the Grand Palace, a Wat (temple) or two and maybe the weekend Chatuchak market. I knew I would tick off those things, but I also just wanted to wander round and get a feel for the place and Thailand in general, sample some of the great food I'd read so much about and catch up with an old school friend, Met, on his home turf.

I spent the first few days exploring various neighbourhoods and their street food options, muttering a few words of badly pronounced Thai, making lots of pointing gestures and somehow ending up with plates of very tasty food in front of me.

I wouldn't have had a clue what I was doing or where I was going if it wasn't for two websites, both by the same guy in fact. If you are ever in Bangkok and overwhelmed by the endless food options and just need a friendly point in the right direction, seriously, check out [Migrationology](http://migrationology.com/ "Migrationology") and [Eating Thai Food](http://eatingthaifood.com/ "Eating Thai Food") by Mark Wiens. Many a time I trusted Mark's recommendations and was rewarded with finding a real hidden gem of a restaurant or stall down some little sidestreet that you would never normally go down. There's something rather pleasing about being the only foreigner eating in a restaurant packed by locals, serving great, cheap, and tasty food.

By pure chance I ended up choosing the wettest day of the week to do the bulk of my sightseeing, and after a frantic but fun little boat ride up the Chao Phraya river in the pelting rain I enjoyed wandering round the Grand Palace and Wat Pho and taking a few photos. One thing I did realise, though, is how irritated I get when surrounded by other tourists all lining up, one after the other, to take the same average holiday snaps. Hopefully the ones I took are a bit better than theirs. See my next blog post for details...

At the weekend I popped up to the famous Chatuchak market to have a nose around, and it was impressively large and eclectic, full of everything you can imagine. If you're looking for nick-nacks of all sorts, second-hand shoes or plastic flowers, for example, it's the market for you. The thing is, I quickly realised I wasn't really looking to buy anything because I've only just started my trip so I have everything I need at the moment. Plus it's far too early to start buying any souvenirs or presents.

On the Sunday I met up with Met for the second time (we had gone for lunch earlier in the week) and he took me on a little roadtrip south to what must be one of Thailand's only vineyards. After a bit of wine-tasting, in Thailand, who knew?! we watched the sun go down and ate at a lovely restaurant on the beach. It was great to catch up with Met (we went to school together) and find out what he's been up to - quite a lot by the sound of things, seen as he's got his own luxury male accessories brand [Mettique](http://www.mettique.com) which seems to be going well!

The whole time I was in Bangkok I was staying at [Lub D Hostel Silom](http://silom.lubd.com/) and I was really impressed. Yes it cost a bit more than a grotty shithole off Khao San Road, but it was still only 400 baht (£8) a night and it was REALLY good. It's a modern, clean and well-thought out place, close to a SkyTrain station - so easy to get to from the airport - and with really friendly staff and great attention to detail. Things like free popcorn, minty shower gel and bubblegum flavoured soap are trivial but they make you smile and remember the place. Also there's a nice bar downstairs where everyone tends to hang out in the evenings and where I made some new friends.

Despite conversations inevitably starting with the same few questions "Where are you from?", "How long are you here?", "Where are you going next?" etc... many more interesting conversations were had, inevitably eased by bottles of Leo (my Thai beer of choice it seems) and Sangsam, the infamous Thai rum.

On Sunday night in particular, a group of us ventured up to one of Bankgkok's famous sky bars, Sirocco, for a delicious but overpriced cocktail-with-a-view, before heading over to Khao San Road and settling in for a legendary session that went on until the early hours. I thought Khao San Road was fun, but tamer than I imagined. Perhaps I need to come back in high season to see it at its most raucous.

So in summary I thought Bangkok wasn't so bad. I enjoyed it, but then again I don't mind being in cities and it's still the start of my trip so I'm easily pleased and still thrilled to be away. It's worth noting that I largely steered clear of Bangkok's more seedy side and decided to not go to a ping pong show - everyone I spoke to who had gone seemed to have been ripped-off or nearly ripped-off. But hey, I'll probably be in Bangkok again pretty soon and I probably do need to tick that disturbing box once...

On the 23rd September I packed up my bag and got on a flight north to Chiang Mai where I'll be holed up for several weeks, hopefully trying to get some web work done. In the meantime, here are a few tips for Bangkok.

Guru's Tips for Bangkok
=====================

Use the SkyTrain to get around
---------------------
I was really impressed with the SkyTrain, and the Rail Link to Suvarnabhumi airport. It is a clean, efficient and cheap way of getting about the city, and to the bigger airport. The SkyTrain only has two proper lines, but they cover most of the interesting parts of Bangkok (apart from the historical center which is a shame, but pretty much everywhere else of note).

Get a Thai Sim Card as soon as you can
---------------------
You can pick one up from the nearest 7/11 for 50 baht (£1), and data packages are cheap and really easy to setup. Having access to Google Maps in particular makes a foreign city far less daunting, so make sure you bring your unlocked smartphone from home if you can.

Fix any electronics at the MBK Mall
---------------------
As soon as I left Dubai, my iPhone point blank refused to charge which was quite worrying (it had been playing up for months). Seen as my warranty was out of date the official Apple store wasn't interested so I popped over to the MBK Mall where I had it repaired in no time. Bargain hard but it seems like there is no electronic item that can't be fixed at the MBK Mall.

Eat the street-food
---------------------
Did I mention that already? Seriously it's so cheap, roughly 80p a meal, read this article if you're stuck [16 Bangkok Street Food Sanctuaries](http://migrationology.com/2011/05/top-16-bangkok-street-food-sanctuaries/)
