I'd been wanting to come to Chiang Mai for some time. I knew it was a key stop on the tourist trail through Thailand, that it was also a popular hangout for expats and in particular "digital nomads", and that an old friend from school, Leo, had been living there for 18 months.

It seemed like the perfect place to properly acclimatise to being in Asia and settle in to my new lifestyle of travelling while doing my web work.

## Tourist hotspot
Its such a big tourist hotspot because it serves as a great base for exploring the North of Thailand, with all its mountains, jungle, elephants, remote hill tribes etc. 

There are also countless activities on offer, including Thai cookery courses, yoga classes, Thai massage classes, Muay Thai fights and courses, white-water rafting, ziplining, elephant riding, the list goes on...

It's also a good stop-off point before venturing across into Laos which is only a few hours away.

## Expat hangout
There's a sizeable expat community here, largely made up of English language teachers, "web people" of some capacity, and practictioners of what I can only describe as "new age" things.

Many seem to be drawn here because of the ridiculously low cost of living matched with a high quality of life, and for the "web people" there's also reasonable internet speeds.

I've heard it said many times that the only thing missing from Chiang Mai is a beach!

## Initial impressions
When I first turned up in late September, I was struck by how small it felt. The airport is so close to the centre (a bit like Marrakech), that before you know it you are within the old city walls, exploring its narrow lanes, crammed with boutique hotels and guesthouses, fruit-shake stalls, restaurants and massage parlours.

The Old City has a very laid-back and "large town" feel to it, where you could just potter round on a bike or moped from your yoga class to a massage place without a care in the world. It certainly didn't feel like Thailand's second largest city.

BUT it is easy to get carried away like that in the comfortable cocoon of the Old City, and be misled about Chiang Mai. The fact is that the city sprawls on for ages, and there is lots more to experience outside of the Old City, and the traffic out there does get much more hectic! 

## An extended visit
I decided to stay in Chiang Mai for several weeks, out of curiosity but also serendipity. Essentially when I got round to planning my visit, Leo said he'd be away for most of October as he was heading off trekking in Nepal, but if I wanted to I could look after his flat while he was away. As long as I got there a bit before he left and stayed a bit after, he'd still be able to show me round.

This sounded ideal because I'd be able to properly explore the place without worrying about overstaying my welcome, I'd have time to get some web work done, but also have a nice introduction and send-off from a "local". 

## The traveller/expat balance 
Seen as I was staying in Chiang Mai for so long, I was conscious that I would have to strike a balance between living like a traveller and living like an expat.

I decided to do some touristy activities every week, of course, but on other days I was happy just going out for some nice food, chilling in a random cafe and getting some work done, or going to the gym or to the cinema. Despite being in Thailand there's no way I'm going to miss keeping up-to-date with my films!

Also there were nights that I wanted to go out and party with the other backpackers at the infamous Zoe in Yellow strip of bars, but other nights I just wanted to sit in a bar with a beer watching the footie - many more games are televised outside the UK of course.

### Touristy activities
I did my fair share of touristy activities while in the Chiang Mai area, and I'll describe them in more detail in other posts perhpas, but here are some of the things I got up to:

#### Thai cooking course with [Thaifarmcooking](http://www.thaifarmcooking.net/)
Entertaining and tasty.

#### Visit to [Patara Elephant Farm](www.pataraelephantfarm.com/)
Expensive and it was unfortunately a very rainy day but it was memorable nonetheless. Action shots to come...

#### Watching a Muay Thai fight
Make sure to go the local arena (fights on Fridays) and not the touristy arena near Tha Pae gate.

#### White-water rafting with [SiamRivers](http://siamrivers.com/)
Intense and scenic, but alas over too soon! Action shots to come...

#### Riding a moped up to Doi Suthep temple, and on to Doi Poi village
A nice scenic day trip

#### Celebrating Loi Krathong/Yi Peng
A spectacular send-off that coincided with my birthday

## Obvervations on the Chiang Mai quality of life
### Cafe culture
Chiang Mai has a great cafe culture, perfectly suited to "digital nomads" or other "laptop workers". The coffee tends to be great quality as much of it is grown locally, and it's pretty cheap, as in 50 baht (£1) for a latte. Most places have free wifi and there's no pressure to keep buying drinks, you can typically stay as long as you want - perfect for those long coding sessions!

I found the best cafes for working tended to be located in the Nimmanhaemin region, to the Northwest of the centre, where all the students tend to hang out. Play Cafe was my favourite.

### Fruit shakes
No day in Chiang Mai is complete without a daily helping of fresh fruit, it just seems so abundant and cheap out here compared to back home!

As for fruit shakes, everywhere seemed pretty good, and in my opinion you can't go wrong with a mango and passionfruit shake, typically 25 baht (50p), and make sure you try a bottle of passionfruit juice!

### Massages
Getting a massage every now and then is a must in Thailand, seeing as a 1 hour full body massage typically costs 200 baht (£4).

### Yoga
I dabbled in yoga with my first ever session at [Namo Yoga](www.namochiangmai.org/), and it went well, but I think I need to do a beginner's course before I do any more. I heard that the [Yoga Tree](www.theyogatree.org/‎) offers beginners lessons but I never got round to going. I'm sure I'll find somewhere else suitable on my travels.

### Great food
Like all of Thailand I've seen so far, Chiang Mai has great food options, most of the time from local places serving cheap and delicious Thai food. When in Chiang Mai make sure to try the Khao Soy, a local speciality, which is typically chicken and noodles served in curry-flavoured coconut soup!

As for breakfast I don't think you can beat the fresh fruit salad with yoghurt and muesli from Happy Smoothies, just 50 baht (£1).

### Going to the gym
As for a suitable gym in Chiang Mai I only looked at two, but found one that served my needs. [Fitness Thailand](www.fitnessthailand.co.th/‎) seemed very well equipped but a bit too expensive and inflexible for me - monthly membership 1500 baht (£30). The one I preffered was [Kawee Powerzone](http://www.kaweepowerzone.com/), at top of the Kad Suan Keuw shopping centre, where I could pop in for 50 baht (£1) a visit. It was a bit tricky to find as all the website was in Thai and the equipment was a bit dated, but it did the job.

### Going to the cinema
The best cinema I found in Chiang Mai was the [Major Cineplex](http://www.majorcineplex.com/en/cinema/major-chiangmai/) at the Airport Plaza Shopping Centre. It's a very modern place, that shows all the latest films in English, often before they are released in the UK. Entry is about 170 baht (£3.40) - a nice change from London! Just make sure to stand for the National Anthem before the film starts - that would never happen in the UK!

### Bombing around on a scooter
I managed to rent a 100cc scooter for a month for just 2100 baht (£42), which worked out at just 70 baht (£1.40) a day, which I thought was an absolute steal.

Having a scooter made travelling around the city so much easier, and meant that I could go to those restaurants or cafes that are bit further away without having to worry about tuk-tuks or songthaews (pick-up truck taxis) etc.

I highly recommend getting one if you are going to be in town for more than a few days. I got mine from a place called Jaguar, which was recommended to me, and they have been very helpful, friendly (even when I lost the keys), and they are cheap. Highly recommended.

--------------------
All in all I had a very enjoyable few weeks in Chiang Mai. I also got a fair bit of web work done and picked up a few new clients, more on that later.
