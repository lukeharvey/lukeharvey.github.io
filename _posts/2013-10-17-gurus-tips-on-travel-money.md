I have to admit that as well as being a tech geek, I've always been a bit of a personal finance geek. Travel money is not the most exciting topic, but due to my current circumstances I think I have some valuable insight to share on this topic, especially as I keep seeing it done badly.

## Don't bother buying foreign currency before you travel
The easiest, simplest and best way to get your foreign currency is to just **use your debit card in foreign ATMs**. There are ATMs in all but the smallest airports these days, and you will get a much better exchange rate than if you went to a foreign currency booth. Who has even heard of travellers' cheques these days anyway?

Also, by using foreign ATMs, and just withdrawing as much as you need every few days, you can **limit how much cash you are carrying at any one time**. This is much safer than arriving in a foreign country, possibly jetlagged and disorientated, with the money for your entire holiday bulging out of your pockets - an obvious target for any pickpockets and thieves.

### Exception - carry some US dollars for emergencies/visas etc
If I am at all concerned about the country I'm going to, if I'm heading off on a long trip of backpacking, or I know I will have to pay for a visa on arrival somewhere, I'll typically take some **US dollars with me in cash**. I'd say you just need enough to cover you for a few days in case your cards don't work, or in case everything else gets stolen, perhaps $100-200.

To get the best rate for said dollars, always shop online using something like the [Travel Money Max](http://travelmoney.moneysavingexpert.com/) tool. Don't use the exchange booths at the airport unless you have reserved some cash with them online in advance for a better rate.

**Don't carry these dollars with you all the time**, lock them up in your hostel/hotel safe as soon as you can, and on the days that you are travelling, don't carry them in your normal wallet with your debit card.

## Don't use just ANY old debit card
Don't just rock up in the foreign country with your Natwest, Lloyds, Santander or other UK high-street bank debit card. These banks typically charge you **withdrawal fees on any foreign cash withdrawals**, which all start to add up but which, with a bit of planning, are completely avoidable.

e.g. I have a debit card with Natwest, and *if I did use that for my foreign currency withdrawals*, they would slap me every time with a withdrawal fee of 2% (min £2, max £5). If I used this 5 times over a 2 week holiday, each time withdrawing £100, then I would have paid over £10 in fees! That's more than a round of 4 pints at the Digby Tap, and I know which option I'd rather have.

The reality is there are UK banks that offer debit cards that **DO NOT charge for foreign cash withdrawals AT ALL**. They just exchange the currency you have withdrawn at their daily bank rate, which is often the best that non-currency-trading mortals can get. Just by opening up a current account with them, free of charge, they will give you a SPECIAL debit card which is much better to use when abroad.

Nationwide used to offer bank account like this, but they withdrew that feature a few years ago. Luckily, one of the UK's newest banks, [Metro Bank](https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/), now offer a very similar product - **a current account with a debit card that doesn't charge you for any foreign purchases or cash withdrawals** - exactly what we are looking for.

## Before your next trip, open a new current account with Metro Bank, then use their debit card
A sad fact I read somewhere is that about British people are more likely to get a new spouse than a new bank account, but that's what I recommend you do. 

Opening a new bank account will not affect your old bank account in any way - you don't have to change any of your direct debits, you don't have to tell your employer to change the way your salary is paid or anything like that - **it won't cost you anything** - in fact Metro Bank even give you £3 just for opening an account. It's just going to sit there, waiting for you to use it. And you're only going to use it for the occasional foreign ATM withdrawal - it's that simple.

Unfortunately you can't apply for a current account from Metro Bank online, you have to go into one of their [branches in person](https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/Our-Stores/OurStores/), and at the moment most of their branches are in London. But don't let that put you off because the **whole process can take as little as 30 minutes**, they are open on Sundays, and they even print off your debit card there and then - no waiting for it to arrive in the post.

So next time you are in London with 30 minutes to spare, pop into a branch of Metro Bank and open a current account. **Make sure you sign up for their online banking service**, so you can easily keep an eye on your balance.

You will then be in possession of a debit card that will not charge you for any foreign cash withdrawals and you will be laughing.

## Transfer money to your new *travel* bank account only when you need it
Another benefit of having a separate bank account for your foreign currency withdrawals, is that is protects you in case your card is stolen or cloned by thieves.

Only transfer money into this account as and when you need it, e.g. a few days before your next withdrawal, so the **maximum amount that any thieves can withdraw from the account is greatly reduced**, and there is no threat of them messing up any of your other payments.

## If asked, choose to be charged in the foreign currency not pounds
If you are using a foreign ATM and the machine asks if you wish to be charged in the foreign currency or in pounds, **always choose the foreign currency**. You will get a better exchange rate.

## Find foreign ATMs that also don't charge
If you've done everything I've said and you are using your Metro Bank debit card to withdraw cash from foreign ATMs, you won't be charged by Metro Bank. You might, however, be **charged by the foreign bank for the withdrawal**, and there's not that much you can do about that, except find banks abroad that don't charge. When you find them, make sure you remember them! 

e.g. I am currently in Thailand, and most ATMs will charge you 180 baht (£3+) for each withdrawal with a UK debit card, but there is one branch of banks, **Aeon Bank**, that does not charge. If I can find an Aeon Bank branch nearby, I will obviously use that one instead.

If anyone knows of a major US bank that doesn't charge for foreign ATM withdrawals, I would really like to know!

------------
Anyway, if you follow my instructions I hope your future travels go well and I look forward to all the drinks we can have next time I see you, due to all the money you've saved on bank charges.

Mine's a cider, cheers 'en!
